# Google Sheets -> Interactive table
Files for a one-hour class for ["Create a searchable, sortable online table in a few easy steps"](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3190/3950/) at [IRE 2018 in Orlando, Florida](https://ire.org/conferences/ire-2018/).

- **When:** Friday, June 15 at 5 p.m.

- **Where:** Coral A

- **What:** In this session, we'll use a template with a little Javascript to transform a Google spreadsheet into an interactive table that your readers can use to search and sort your data. (Getting the table into your newsroom CMS will probably be beyond the scope of this session, unfortunately ðŸ˜¬.) Note: You will need a Google Drive account.

- **Teachers:** Me

- **Prerequisites:** This session is good for: People who work with data in spreadsheets. Some basic familiarity with HTML is helpful but not required.

## Overview

This template uses two Javascript libraries:
- [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop), to get your data out of Google Sheets in one piece, and
- [List.js](http://listjs.com/), to handle searching and sorting
